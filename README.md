# Firebase Introduction

A repo containing my practice on Firebase. I mostly had an overview about creating a firebase project, connecting it to a form and displaying data from Firebase to the console.

## Contribution

To contribute, simply fork and clone this repo, and run `npm install` to install firebase and webpack cli.

Then, run `npm run build`, and view the results in your browser
